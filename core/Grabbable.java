 * <p>
 * Each application object willing to subscribe a group of user defined actions should either implement the Grabber
 * interface or extend from the {@link remixlab.bias.core.Grabber} class (which provides a default
 * implementation of that interface), and override the following two methods: {@link #checkIfGrabsInput(BogusEvent)},
 * which defines the rules to set the application object as the agents {@link remixlab.bias.core.Agent#grabber()}; and,
 * {@link #performInteraction(BogusEvent)}, which defines how the application object should behave according to a given
 * bogus event, which may be parameterized to hold a user-defined action.
